### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Engagement

I actively follow and engage with open-source projects that align with my work in AI/ML, backend systems, and MLOps. Some notable repositories I follow and learn from include:

- [langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): A powerful framework for building context-aware LLM applications. I use LangChain in my RAG-based chatbot projects.
- [mlflow/mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow): A leading platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. I'm exploring experiment tracking and model deployment with MLflow.
- [iterative/dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dvc): Git-like version control for ML pipelines and data. I'm incorporating DVC in my AI Studio project to ensure reproducibility.
- [pydantic/pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic): A fast, type-safe data validation library used in many of my Python and FastAPI projects.

These projects inspire my work and reflect the kind of engineering practices I strive to follow — reproducibility, clarity, and modular design.
